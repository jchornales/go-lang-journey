# 🧠 My Golang Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal roadmap and documentation for learning **Golang** as a frontend developer transitioning into full-stack development. I'm already proficient in **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, and **REST APIs** — now I'm adding **Go** to my backend toolkit.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To become a proficient **full-stack developer** using **Next.js (frontend)** and **Golang (backend)**, capable of building modern, scalable, and high-performance web applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Vision

| Layer       | Tech                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Frontend    | Next.js, React, TypeScript   |
| Backend API | Golang (Gin or Fiber)        |
| Database    | PostgreSQL or SQLite         |
| API Style   | REST / GraphQL (with gqlgen) |
| Auth        | JWT                          |
| DevOps      | Docker, Railway, Fly.io      |
