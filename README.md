## Introduction

This repository is a personal log and resource collection for my Go learning journey. I will document what I learn, challenges I face, and projects I build along the way.

## Why Go?

Go (Golang) is a statically typed, compiled language designed for simplicity, concurrency, and performance. It's widely used in cloud infrastructure, web servers, and scalable systems.

## Learning Roadmap

1. **Go Basics**

   - Setting up Go environment
   - Syntax and basic types
   - Control structures (if, for, switch)
   - Functions and error handling

2. **Intermediate Go**

   - Structs and interfaces
   - Packages and modules
   - Testing in Go
   - Working with files and IO

3. **Advanced Go**

   - Concurrency (goroutines, channels)
   - Networking and web servers
   - Reflection and generics (Go 1.18+)
   - Performance optimization

4. **Expert Level**
   - Building production-ready applications
   - Contributing to open source Go projects
   - Advanced debugging and profiling
   - System design with Go
